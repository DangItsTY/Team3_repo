Question(s):

1) A general operating system question: What makes Linux-like operating systems more "stable" than something like Windows? I read online that Linux in general is much more stable that Windows and I am curious as to what that means.

2) What is the main difference between the terminal and a DOS window or the cmnd line functions in Windows?
